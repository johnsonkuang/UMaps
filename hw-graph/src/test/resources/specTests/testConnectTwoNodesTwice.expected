# Test two different connections between nodes
# Test whether two edges with different labels can be made between
# two nodes in a graph

# Create graph
created graph graph1

# Add two nodes
added node A to graph1
added node B to graph1

# Add two edges with A as the parent and B as the child
added edge e1 from A to B in graph1
added edge e2 from A to B in graph1

# List the children of A, should contain B twice
the children of A in graph1 are: B(e1) B(e2)
