Part 1. (Written exercises)

(a)
    (i) IntQueue1:
            Abstraction Function:
                IntQueue1, q1, represents an enqueued series of numbers [n_1, n_2 ... n_k] where n1 is the least-recently added item, and
                nk is the most-recently added item;
                append(n_k) = [] if n_k is null
                               append(n_k-1) : n_k if n_k != null

             Rep Invariant:
                entries != null
    (ii) IntQueue2:
            Abstraction Function:
                IntQueue2, q2, represents an enqueued series of numbers [n_1, n_2 ... n_k] where n1 is the least-recently added item, and
                nk is the most-recently added item;
                append(n_k) = [] if n_k is null
                               append(n_k-1) : n_k if n_k != null

            Rep Invariant:
                entries != null &&
                0 <= front < entries.length &&
                size <= entries.length

(b) Group 1: A, D, G | Group 2: B, H | Group 3: C, F | Group 4: E


(c)
    (i) The method does not expose representation because it returns a primitive int type.
    (ii) The method could have returned a reference to an internal field, so it exposed representation.
    (iii) The method is a private method within the class therefore it does not expose representation.
    (iv) The method returns a string, which is immutable, therefore it does not expose representation.
    (v) Iterators are immutable but the objects you're iterating through are, however since you're iterating through Integers which are
        immutable, it does not expose representation.
    (vi) Depending on if the cards parameter is used as an internal field, this method exposes representation because the client
         can modify the list via cards to change the cards stored in the Deck object.
