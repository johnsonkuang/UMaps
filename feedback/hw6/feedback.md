#### Overall Feedback

Good job overall - some minor issues in documentation and testing.

#### More Details

Your documentation should describe the properties of the Graph constructed.

Private methods should have a comment describing them.

Your test suite is lacking in coverage.  Here's a few ideas for interesting test
cases:
- Empty data file.
- Loading two graphs.
- Operations that mix graph loading and building.
- Cyclic graphs with path finding.
- Lexicographically least paths.
