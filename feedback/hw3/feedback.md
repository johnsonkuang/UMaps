#### General Feedback

- When selecting a greeting in `RandomHello`, the best style would use the length
of the array to specify the maximum value for the random integer generation

- Your BallContainer add/remove methods are more complicated than they need to be.
Look at the documentation for `Set.add` and `Set.remove` and see whether you
need to explicitly handle cases the cases of adding something that already
exists in the set and removing something that doesn't exist in the set.
