Problem 6.

(a) The method received a negative number, it is resolved when we address the second test.


(b) The method checked for n <= 0 and thus did not terminate correctly. Changing to n < 0 in the base case resolves this issue.


(c) The method checked for n <= 2 and subtracted the terms instead of adding them. Changing to check for n <= 1 and adding the terms resolves these issues.
