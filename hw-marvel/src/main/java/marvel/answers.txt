Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from previous assignments,
and why those changes were made below. If you made no changes, state that
explicitly. (See the marvel assignment spec for details.)

Added a contains() method that checks for the existence of a node in the graph, although
addNode() implicitly checks for nodes, it's better to be explicit in my opinion.

Changed the data structure that stores nodes in Graph from HashSet to a HashMap of the
String label of the node to the Node object because it leads to faster lookup times for specific
nodes in the graph based on label.
